Instructions
==================

Design and Implement a mock real-time trading UI to showcase your programming abilities and principles across the full application stack.

There is no firm requirement on using real data but your application should demonstrate understanding of strategies and methods for utilising realtime data streams.

This service can be a mock with random data, but you are welcome to use a public API also. 

The trading dashboard you develop should contains 4 separate widgets: 

- A charting widget e.g to show candlestick data
- An order entry ticket to allow the user to buy and sell by inputing the price, qty 
- A position widget
- An order book widget


_Technology Stack:_ 

This is open to your preference.

We have a current preference for React/Typescript/Xstate but you are free to choose.

- Node / React / Xstate / Vue / Redux / Angular / Svelte
- HTML5, CSS3


Feel free to use other libraries and components where applicable, we do not expect you to reinvent the wheel every time, but where possible try to constrain external dependencies.

Subjectively, you should aim to demonstrate your prowess in development not just your ability to use a framework.

Please make it clear why you chose a specific library or framework.

Bonus points:

Module Federation
E2E testing
Inter widget communication.

Plese send your completed work to jane.ooi@crypto.com either as a zip file, publically accessible repositiory.
